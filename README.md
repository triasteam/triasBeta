## A Note on Production Readiness

While Trias is being used in production in private, permissioned
environments, we are still working actively to harden and audit it in preparation
for use in public blockchains.
We are also still making breaking changes to the protocol and the APIs.
Thus, we tag the releases as *alpha software*.

In any case, if you intend to run Trias in production,
please [contact us](mailto:contact@trias.one) and [join the chat](https://www.trias.one).

## Security

### Upgrades

Trias is responsible for the code and documentation upgrades for all Trias modules. In an effort to avoid accumulating technical debt prior to Beta, we do not guarantee that data breaking changes (ie. bumps in the MINOR version) will work with existing Trias blockchains. In these cases you will have to start a new blockchain, or write something custom to get the old data into the new chain.
